# Getting started to program in C

This project contains information to install the GNU C compiler binary and the GNU make system to help compile C programs. This would be one of the first steps to be ready to start writing programs and run them. This tutorial assums that you have a computer with an internet connection which is running either Windows (Windows 10, 11, 7), Linux (Ubunbut/Debian) or MacOS. 

Please contact the administrator if you need help identifying your computer architecture or operating system. The following tutoral should work on most systems.

The turorial will take you through the follwing steps:

1. Identify the operating system running on your laptop.
2. Idenfiy your machine's architecture.
3. Obtaining the right compier.
4. Installation of the compiler.
5. Obtaining and installing a Itegrated Development Environment, IDE. 
6. Running the first program.


## Identify your operating system.

### Windows

### Linux

### MACOS

## Identify your machine, the architecture.

A machine "_architecture_" loosely refers to the type of processor that is being used on the machine on which the compiler is being installed. Depending on the manufacturer, brand and when the device was manufacturd, there may be variations. In this guide, only a simple discussion based on the most popular devices avaliable now is discussed. However, there are a number of specialised devices and architectures, which while may use the same compiler as us, the installtion is out of scope of the current
